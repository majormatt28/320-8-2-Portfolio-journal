- The way I can ensure my code is functional and secure is by make test cases and seeing if they pass those test cases as well as it compiling properly from run the code.
- I try to picture myself as the user and see what is it that I would like as a consumer rather than being a developer. Making sure it is streamlined and also intuitive for those who are unfamilar with the application can pick it up easily.
- One of my approaches to designing software is to think what will appeal to a client rather than seeing if I can cut corners just to make my life easier as a developer.
